# Lecture 11: Profiling & Optimisation 


When to optimise?

- Make it work: write the code in a simple, readable, and maintainable way.
- Make it reliable: write tests and make sure that if we break the code, the tests will let us know
- Measure, measure, measure: Measure the performance, do not guess!
- Convince ourselves that our code is too slow: Does it hurt if it runs too slow?
- Consider the costs of optimisation: Hardware is cheaper than the developer time.
- Optimise until the code is fast enough and not as fast as possible.
