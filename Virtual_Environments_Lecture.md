# Virtual Environments Lecture


Using virtual environments, you are still grabbing from pip eg. using pip install etc and the python website.

However, Conda has its own packages so, conda add grabs it from different location online.

Can also create environment from conda using:
```conda create -n condatest ```

Then need to activate it eg. ```conda activate condatest``` 

Can also specify the Python version in it. But note that it will behave in a similar to virtual environments but will grab installs from from Conda packages.
