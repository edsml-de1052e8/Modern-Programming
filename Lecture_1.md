## Lecture 1: Introduction to Modern Programming & SciPy




Supplementary reading:
Optional! 

General Info:
You will however get good marks if you do all the exercises 
Lectures in the morning, complete the exercises in the afternoon and aim to be done at the end of the day
Assessment released on Tuesday and released Friday at 4pm 
Go through lectures for couple mins maybe before lecture





SciPy

Learn what NumPy arrays are
Basic array manipulations
Vectorial code
sciPy
2D plot
Combining plots

Reading:
Nature paper


SciPy: ecosystem of  open source software which includes: 
NumPy
Matplotlib
Pandas 
Sympy 
It supports multidimensional arrays, matrices, linear algebra operations, random number transformation, Fourier transforms, polynomials etc

Pybrt 
Used to get feedback on repetitive problems 
Copy constructor: ```b= np.array (a)
Print (b)```

Use ‘type’ function to check what kind of data you are dealing with eg. float, string

Key array attributes
A.shape
Ndim functions

Multidimensional array: basically a list of list eg. ```np.array([1, 5,6],
[4,5,6])```
