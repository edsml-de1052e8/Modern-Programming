- working on pytest, good coding practice, ...

- make sure softwares are set up correctly. (message thi afternoon if ever)
- Main reference doc for assessment completion
- Don't really need to understand how Gaussian elimination works
- Need to know how two matrices can be multiplied and how to figure out determinant 

a)
- use test docstring functionality, all examples used in docstring should be valid examples

Next step is making 4 worflows:
1 .can use flake 8 --> CI lecture
2.(b) workflow with pytest (using azure?)
3. (c) Anaconda env: pick whatever Github Action you want, recommended: action -> conda incubator mini steup (see lecture on environments)
4. (d) sphinx, after settiing up that action, keep local work inversion up to date with github (basically do frequent git pulls)
-> can ask on Teams about this and how to keep things in sync tbf

Last step:
- optimisation: lecture 11 
- matrix, table 1: first column is length of objects, middle colummn is time of Gauss takes and last column is time for numpy to compute

-(b) can use any algorithm, just reference it in docstring if found online. and add timings to final column of timings scripts
